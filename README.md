# map-my-travels
A simple travel mapping app. 

My first solo attempt at a complete web application using mostly Node.js and vanilla Javascript. 
A personal project created out of the desire to map the countries and cities I have visited thus far. 

Utilizes Mapbox APIs for mapping and geocoding, and Google Chart for building Pie Charts.
